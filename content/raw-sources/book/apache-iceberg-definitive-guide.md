Traditional data architecture patterns are severely limited. To use these patterns, you have to ETL data into each toolâ€”a cost-prohibitive process for making warehouse features available to all of your data. The lack of flexibility with these patterns requires you to lock into a set of priority tools and formats, which creates data silos and data drift. This practical book shows you a better way.

Apache Iceberg provides the capabilities, performance, scalability, and savings that fulfill the promise of an open data lakehouse. By following the lessons in this book, you'll be able to achieve interactive, batch, machine learning, and streaming analytics with this high-performance open source format. Authors Tomer Shiran, Jason Hughes, and Alex Merced from Dremio show you how to get started with Iceberg.

With this book, you'll learn:

- The architecture of Apache Iceberg tables
- What happens under the hood when you perform operations on Iceberg tables
- How to further optimize Iceberg tables for maximum performance
- How to use Iceberg with popular data engines such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, and Dremio. Discover why Apache Iceberg is a foundational technology for implementing an open data lakehouse.
