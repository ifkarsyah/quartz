---

- **Industry**: Telecommunications
- **Use Case**: Telecom companies use Flink to process data from IoT devices and sensors deployed across large networks. Flink processes this data to monitor network performance, detect faults, and trigger alerts when specific conditions are met.
- **Example**: A smart city project uses Flink to monitor data from thousands of sensors, such as traffic cameras, air quality monitors, and smart streetlights, to optimize traffic flow and ensure environmental standards are met.

## Uber
Uber leverages Flink to process data from its network of IoT devices and sensors, including GPS data from drivers and riders. Flink enables Uber to monitor real-time events, optimize routes, and ensure the safety and efficiency of its services.
