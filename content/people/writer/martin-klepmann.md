I’m Dr. Martin Kleppmann. I do various things:
- I am an Associate Professor at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/), working on [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html) collaboration software and distributed systems security.
- In 2017 I published a book for [O’Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com/), called [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/). It covers the architecture of a broad range of databases and distributed data processing systems, and it is one of the best-selling titles in the publisher’s entire catalogue.
- I am a regular [speaker at conferences](https://martin.kleppmann.com/talks.html), and [recordings of my talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeKd45zvjcDHJxge6VtYUAbYnvd_VNQCx) have been watched over 500,000 times.
- I have worked on various open source projects including [Automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge), [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/), and [Apache Samza](https://samza.apache.org/).
- Between 2007 and 2014 I was an industrial software engineer and entrepreneur. I co-founded [Rapportive](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rapportive) ([acquired](http://allthingsd.com/20120207/linkedin-is-acquiring-contacts-start-up-rapportive/) by [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/) in 2012) and [Go Test It](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/go-test-it) ([acquired](https://thenextweb.com/uk/2009/12/02/red-gate-software-acquire-gotestit-testing-environment-start-ups/) by [Red Gate Software](http://www.red-gate.com/) in 2009).
